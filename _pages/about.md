Hello, Welcome to my page. I'm now a final year undergraduate student of Software Engineering in [Shandong University of Science and Technology](https://www.sdust.edu.cn/). My research interest focus on leveraging DL for complex time series data, such as pulse data, and computer vision. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yanfang, Yin](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3510-3862) of Information Systems Integration Laboratory.
