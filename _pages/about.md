Hello, Welcome to my page. I'm now a final year undergraduate student of Software Engineering in [Shandong University of Science and Technology](https://www.sdust.edu.cn/). My research interest focus on leveraging DL for complex time series data, such as pulse data, and computer vision. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yanfang, Yin](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3510-3862) of Information Systems Integration Laboratory.

    <div class="project-title">TCN and GRU-Based Lumbar Disc Disease Detection</div>
    <div class="project-description"> 
      Developed an intelligent model for diagnosing lumbar disc disease using deep learning to address noise and complexity inherent in traditional Chinese pulse wave data. Identified TCN+GRU model as optimal, achieving approximately 81% accuracy through 16-fold cross-validation, enhanced the accuracy of traditional Chinese pulse diagnostics in lumbar disc disease detection. Drafted sections of related papers detailing experimental workflows, and data analysis, with one manuscript currently under peer review as a third author in a JCR Q1 journal
